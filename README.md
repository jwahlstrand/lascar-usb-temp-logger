# lascar-usb-temp-logger

This program takes temperature and humidity readings from a Lascar LTD USB sensor (EL-USB-RT, also sold by Omega as OM-EL-USB-RT) and uploads them to an InfluxDB server. The code for communicating with the sensor was copied from Roberto Aguilar (repository github.com/rca/lascar-usb-thermometer), who derived it from code written by √Ångel Sancho.
